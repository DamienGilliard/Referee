# Referee
Referee is a georeferenced point cloud registration method that limits the error propagation of registration errors in the georeferencing of the point cloud

> [!CAUTION]
> This registration method is currently in development and the main branch is not yet functional.

For a clear problem statement that Referee aims to solve, please refer to the [problem statement](./problem-statement.md) page.

Hereunder is an image of the typical initial data that Referee will work with. It is a top view of roughly aligned but not fully registred forest point clouds:

# Installation

A full installation guide will be available once the main branch is functional, but in the mean time we can state that this code is developped on ubuntu 24.04 and macos sequoia, and that the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) currently contains simplified installation instructions that should work fine, but are subject to change.
